//! Tracy profiling integration — zero cost by default, enabled by the `tracy` Cargo feature.
//!
//! # How to enable
//!
//! Build with `--features tracy` to activate Tracy spans, frame marks, and GPU timestamp queries:
//!
//! ```bash
//! cargo build --profile dev-fast --features tracy
//! ```
//!
//! Then launch the [Tracy GUI](https://github.com/wolfpld/tracy) and connect on port **8086**.
//! Tracy uses `ondemand` mode, so data is only streamed while a GUI is connected.
//!
//! # Default builds (no `tracy` feature)
//!
//! Every macro and function in this module compiles to nothing. The `profiling` crate guarantees
//! this: when no backend feature is active, `profiling::scope!` and friends expand to `()`.
//! Verify with `cargo expand` if in doubt.
//!
//! # GPU profiling
//!
//! [`GpuProfilerHandle`] wraps [`wgpu_profiler::GpuProfiler`] (only compiled with `tracy`). It
//! connects to the running Tracy client via
//! [`wgpu_profiler::GpuProfiler::new_with_tracy_client`], so pass-level GPU timestamps are
//! bridged into Tracy's GPU timeline.
//!
//! Pass-level timestamp writes (the preferred path) only require [`wgpu::Features::TIMESTAMP_QUERY`].
//! Encoder-level [`GpuProfilerHandle::begin_query`]/[`GpuProfilerHandle::end_query`] additionally
//! require [`wgpu::Features::TIMESTAMP_QUERY_INSIDE_ENCODERS`]; when the adapter is missing that
//! feature the handle is still created but encoder-level queries silently do nothing. When the
//! adapter is also missing [`wgpu::Features::TIMESTAMP_QUERY`], [`GpuProfilerHandle::try_new`]
//! returns [`None`] and a warning is logged; CPU spans still work.
//!
//! # Thread naming
//!
//! Call [`register_main_thread`] once at startup so the main thread appears by name in Tracy. It
//! also starts the Tracy client before any other profiling macro runs. Pass
//! [`rayon_thread_start_handler`] to `rayon::ThreadPoolBuilder::start_handler` so Rayon workers
//! are also named.
