//! Per-frame deferred [`wgpu::Queue::write_buffer`] routing.
//!
//! Record paths that run per-view push their uniform / storage uploads into a
//! [`FrameUploadBatch`] instead of invoking [`wgpu::Queue::write_buffer`] directly. The batch is
//! drained onto the main thread after all per-view recording finishes but before the single
//! [`crate::gpu::GpuContext::submit_frame_batch`] call. All buffered writes therefore land in the
//! queue prior to submit and are visible to every command buffer in the frame, identical to the
//! direct-call serial path.
//!
//! This plumbing decouples queue ownership from parallel recording: a [`FrameUploadBatch`] can be
//! shared as a read-only reference across rayon workers, whereas [`wgpu::Queue`] access during
//! concurrent recording risks host-side ordering bugs on some backends.
