//! [`ComputePass`] trait for encoder-driven compute and mixed compute/copy work.
//!
//! Unlike [`super::raster::RasterPass`], the graph does not open any GPU pass object for compute
//! passes — the implementor receives the context (which includes the [`wgpu::CommandEncoder`])
//! and dispatches compute workgroups or uses the encoder API directly.
