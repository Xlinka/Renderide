//! [`CallbackPass`] trait for CPU-only graph passes.
//!
//! A callback pass has no encoder and records no GPU commands. It runs as a CPU callback during
//! graph execution, typically to:
//! - Perform draw collection, CPU culling, uniform packing, and [`wgpu::Queue::write_buffer`]
//!   uploads (e.g. the world-mesh forward plan pass).
//! - Mutate the per-view [`super::super::blackboard::Blackboard`] with data subsequent raster or
//!   compute passes will consume.
//!
//! Declaring a pass as callback (via `builder.callback()` in `setup`) means the graph compiler
//! expects no resource accesses — the pass is cull-exempt by default since its side effects (Queue
//! writes, blackboard mutations) are not visible through graph resource declarations.
