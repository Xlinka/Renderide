//! [`RasterPass`] trait for graph-managed raster render passes.
//!
//! The graph opens the [`wgpu::RenderPass`] from the compiled [`crate::render_graph::RenderPassTemplate`]
//! and attachment views resolved from the transient pool. The pass records draw commands into the
//! already-open render pass via [`RasterPass::record`].
