//! [`CopyPass`] trait for encoder-driven copy-only work.
//!
//! Copy passes share the same context as [`super::compute::ComputePass`] but are semantically
//! restricted to copy operations (texture/buffer copies, `clear_buffer`, `clear_texture`,
//! staging uploads). The distinction keeps pass intent explicit and allows future scheduling
//! or validation to identify copy-only work.
