//! Clustered forward lighting: shared GPU buffers for per-cluster light lists.
//!
//! [`ClusterBufferCache`] tracks a grow-only high-water-mark over `cluster_light_counts` and
//! `cluster_light_indices` — the only two buffers shared across views. The per-view compute
//! params uniform (`ClusterParams`) is **not** managed here; it lives in
//! `PerViewFrameState::cluster_params_buffer` to avoid a CPU-side write race during parallel
//! per-view recording (see `frame_resource_manager.rs`).
